Lake St. Moritz
St. Moritz, cam7, 2016-1216 shows the same images from dec. 5th! and apparently all images Lake: Saint Moritz
Operator: Mathias Rothermel
Extent of evaluation: 1.10.2016 to 30.4.2017
Cameras: Cam 21 (number as used in 1st year report). Secondary camera used is 23, and even less cam22.

ice-on: 15-17.12
ice-off: difficult to judge due to lack of images, maybe between 30.3 and 6.4
start of freezing: 9.12
end of thawing: at least 26.4 but many previous days with no data

No cloud observations made.

Explanation of lake status:
The % below refers to the visible area of the lake, potentially excluding the far part of the lake which you generally cannot judge, except in case of snow. Clearly these % are a matter of personal judgement and only approximate.

s = snow, when snow is on lake ice, lake frozen to ca. 90-100%
i = ice, frozen lake to ca. 90-100%
w = water, when lake has ca. 90-100% water
ms = more snow, ca. 60-90%, but a small part water
mi = more ice, ca. 60-90%, but a small part water
mw = more water, ca. 60-90%, but a small part frozen
c = clouds or fog covering all lake
u = unclear, when you cannot judge the lake state
n = no webcam data acquired

Lake: Sihl
Operator: Mathias Rothermel
Extent of evaluation: 1.10.2016 to 30.4.2017
Cameras: Cam 12 (number as used in 1st year report; note that the camera is rotating, so the area imaged is not always the same) and during the gap period of Cam 12 from
18.3.2017 to 25.4.2017 the Eawag cam 26 (with very good overview of the Sihlsee from the south) was used.

No cloud observations made.

Lake: Silvaplana
Operator: Manu Tom
Extent of evaluation: 1.10.2016 to 30.4.2017

ice-on: 11-13.1, more probable 12.1
ice-off : 9-13.4, more probable 11.4
Eawag observed a 2nd ice-on/off on 1.1 and 2.1, from webcams only 31.12 maybe all ice
Ice pixels between ice-on/off are mainly before ice-off, and then less just after ice-on

start of freezing: 3-4.12? or more 10.12?
end of thawing: 18.4 probably

Cameras: Mainly used the camera El paradiso (called cam28). In case of doubt, other cams were referred. Since El Paradiso is located far away from the lake, it is very difficult to judge the state of the lake in general, Hence more than one image during a day were used to infer the state of the lake. There are some days in which the state is unclear. In those cases a probable state is also proposed. It is often confusing to judge whether it is ice or shadow of the mountains nearby. It is relatively less tough to judge around 12:30- 13:30 when the sun comes approximately above the lake. Snow is easy to judge. Ice-water confusion exist a lot with this camera. Most of the other cameras capturing Silvaplana are either providing low quality data (compression artefacts) or very far away (high GSD) or very close (covering very limited lake area). Also the panoramic camera Segl-Maria (good resolution but rather far) was used.

The data below has 4 parts

1st: date
2nd: lake status
3rd: cloud status
4th: optionally various comments

c = clouds or fog covering all lake
u = unclear, when you cannot judge the lake state

Manos re-examined images during freezing and thawing and added some comments in ( ).

There were very few days when the lake was totally covered by very low clouds and fog.

Explanation of cloud status:
S (sunny, practically cloudless), MS (more sunny), MC (more clouds), C (totally cloudy)

In some unclear cases a double status was used, e.g. mc/c meaning between more cloudy / cloudy with the first status being usually dominant.

Lake: Sils
Operator: Manos Baltsavias
Extent of evaluation: images till 30.4.2017 checked 2-3 times,
during independent periods, with images during ice-on/off checked
even more than 3 times.
Cameras:
SeglMaria: best quality, panoramic camera, cover all period, has only one image at 12:00 till and 28.1.17. This camera at 12:00 was the main source of evaluation. Images at
other day times were also used.
cam 2-1927 (called 2C below) acquired from 4.12.16 multiple images / day but is very far and of poor quality.
cam 5-8321 (called 3C below, a subpart of SeglMaria) acquired from 4.12.16 multiple images / day, but no good quality.
Cameras 2C and 3C have been used very little in the evaluation, espec. for the
critical periods of ice-on. During ice-off there was a data acquisition gap.

Clouds change during the day. Below we used almost always same time at 12:00 from SeglMaria cam. It would be ideal to use an average time between the Modis and VIIRS overpasses,
however for SeglMaria for many months we had only the 12:00 image. For cloud estimation not only the sky but also the sunshine on the lake surface was checked.

ice-on, rather 2.1 or less 5.1? (checked by all 3 cameras)
ice-off, 8.4 or 11.4? (checked by SeglMaria)

ice-on used here as 1st day totally or in great majority frozen, with a similar day after it (same definition as in Franzen and Scherrer, i.e. end of freeze up).

ice-off used here as the symmetric of ice-on, i.e. the 1st day after having
all or almost all lake frozen, when little but clear water appears and in the subsequent days this water area increases. So, we use it here as thawing (breakup) start. In most cases, espec. in NA (and in the  NSIDC database) ice-off is defined as end of thawing (breakup) when almost everything is water.

Note that before ice-on, lake started freezing in more than one occasion but then warmed up again. Similarly, after thawing end, there were cases of thin ice and then melt on several occasions.

A first remark. There were very few days when the lake was totally covered by very low clouds and fog. An important advantage compared to sat images.

The data has 4 parts

1st: date in format D(D).M(M) The year is clear from filename.
2nd: lake status
3rd: cloud status (we included it since Stefan requested it, but due to time limitations, it may not be included for the other lakes).
4th: optionally various comments. When after 2C or 3C a yes exists, it means evaluation of main camera (SeglMaria) are verified by the camera 2C and/or 3C. The term snow in the
comments refers to snow on land at the front part of the camera.

Explanation of lake status:
The % below refers to the visible area of the lake, potentially excluding the far part of the lake which you generally cannot judge, except in case of snow. Clearly these % are a matter of personal judgement and only approximate.

s = snow, when snow is on lake ice, lake frozen to ca. 90-100%
i = ice, frozen lake to ca. 90-100%
w = water, when lake has ca. 90-100% water
ms = more snow, ca. 60-90%, but a small part water
mi = more ice, ca. 60-90%, but a small part water
mw = more water, ca. 60-90%, but a small part frozen
c = clouds or fog covering all lake
u = unclear, when you cannot judge the lake state

In some cases below c and u may be mixed. Usually when all lake was cloud covered we used u.
If the lake state changes during a day (e.g. when freezing with thin ice or thawing), we tried to find the average daily state of the lake, or used unclear.

Explanation of cloud status:
S (sunny, practically cloudless), MS (more sunny), MC (more clouds), C (totally cloudy)

Is some unclear cases a double status was used, e.g. mc/c meaning between more cloudy / cloudy with the first status being usually dominant.
