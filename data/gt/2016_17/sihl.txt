Lake: Sihl
Operator: Mathias Rothermel
Extent of evaluation: 1.10.2016 to 30.4.2017
Cameras: Cam 12 (number as used in 1st year report; note that the camera is rotating, so the area imaged is not always the same) and during the gap period of Cam 12 from
18.3.2017 to 25.4.2017 the Eawag cam 26 (with very good overview of the Sihlsee from the south) was used.

No cloud observations made.

Explanation of lake status:
The % below refers to the visible area of the lake, potentially excluding the far part of the lake which you generally cannot judge, except in case of snow. Clearly these % are a matter of personal judgement and only approximate.

s = snow, when snow is on lake ice, lake frozen to ca. 90-100%
i = ice, frozen lake to ca. 90-100%
w = water, when lake has ca. 90-100% water
ms = more snow, ca. 60-90%, but a small part water
mi = more ice, ca. 60-90%, but a small part water
mw = more water, ca. 60-90%, but a small part frozen
c = clouds or fog covering all lake
u = unclear, when you cannot judge the lake state
n = no webcam data acquired
